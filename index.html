            <h2>Welcome to Yalda Night Ceremony</h2>
            <p class="justified-text">Imagine this: It is a cold winter night; you are sitting with your friends or family around a table full of delicious snacks. Everything is cozy and lovely; you recount memories and tell jokes. Finally, it is time to take turns reading lyric poetry and make their Yalda night wishes. No one says no to such a wonderful night, right? This is how Persians celebrate the Yalda night, the last night of autumn in the Persian calendar, which is also the longest night of the year.</p>

            <h2>Yalda is More than Just a Night</h2>
            <p class="justified-text">The Yalda night ceremony is admired and revered among Iranians. Although there might be nuances as to how each area of Iran and each ethnic community enjoys this night, they all are united in honoring this ancient tradition.

What is more, Yalda night has influenced many aspects of Iranian art and culture. Not only Yalda has become a popular name for girls, but many also choose this night to mark the major events of their lives (getting married for example). Many Iranian artists and poets have aspired to capture the feeling and image of the Yalda night ceremony. Similarly, fashion and jewelry designers have incorporated the elements of Yalda night (especially the symbolic pomegranate fruit or calligraphic Ghazal poems) into their artistic creations.</p>

 <h2>Chaharshanbe Suri (Fire Festival)</h2>
 <p class="justified-text">Chaharshanbe Suri, also known as the Fire Festival, is celebrated on the eve of the last Wednesday before Nowruz, marking the beginning of the Persian New Year. It usually falls in mid-March. This vibrant festival is one of the most widely celebrated traditional Persian festivals and has deep roots in ancient Zoroastrianism, reflecting themes of purification and renewal.</p>
 <p class="justified-text">Chaharshanbe Suri, the Fire Festival celebrated on the last Wednesday before Nowruz, features the central tradition of jumping over bonfires, a ritual believed to cleanse participants of past misfortunes and bring warmth and vitality for the coming year. People light fires in their neighborhoods and leap over them while singing traditional chants, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness. Fireworks and sparklers further illuminate the night sky, enhancing the festive atmosphere. Special foods like "Ajil," a mix of nuts and dried fruits, and "Kookoo Sabzi," an herb frittata, are prepared for the occasion. The celebration also includes singing, dancing, and moments for seeking forgiveness and offering well-wishes. Overall, Chaharshanbe Suri reflects ancient Persian beliefs in purification and renewal, marking the transition to a new year with a spirit of joy and optimism.</p>

        <h2>Nowruz (Persian New Year)</h2>
        <p class="justified-text">Nowruz, meaning "new day," is the Persian New Year celebrated on the spring equinox, usually March 20th or 21st. It marks the beginning of the year in the Iranian calendar and symbolizes renewal and rebirth.

The celebration lasts for about two weeks, and one of its highlights is the Haft-Seen table, which includes seven symbolic items starting with the Persian letter 'S'.</p>
